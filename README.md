# fire-and-smoke-detector-with-gsm-using-proteus

Requirements : Arduino IDE + Proteus

Description
***********
The project presented here is a GSM Based Fire and Smoke Detection and Prevention With GPS Location Coordinate designed and simulated in Proteus. The system detects fire, gas, or smoke and sends SMS with the location of the premises to the owner or firefighters. The system can also shut down all gas valves and pump out water or an appropriate extinguisher if connected. This is a simulation but can also be physically implemented with real functional components.
